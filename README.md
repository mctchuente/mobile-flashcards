# Mobile Flashcards Project

For the UdaciCards project, you will build a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. 
The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* install expo-cli dependency with `npm install -g expo-cli`
* install react-redux dependency with `yarn add react-redux redux`
* install redux-thunk dependency with `yarn add redux-thunk`
* install react-navigation dependency with `yarn add react-navigation`
* start the development server with `yarn start or expo start`
